# Fake_News_Classification
 Main objective is to  build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.

This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news.  Using sklearn, built a TfidfVectorizer on dataset. Initialized a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model Built MultinomialNB , LSTM and Google Bert model
